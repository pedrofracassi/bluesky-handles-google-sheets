# Bluesky Handles Google Sheets Cloudflare Worker

Long name, I know. This is a Cloudflare Worker script that pulls information from a Google Sheet and returns people's ATProto DIDs for setting up subdomain handles on BlueSky.

So, let's say you own a company and you have a domain like "company.com". You can set up your main BlueSky handle through DNS, and then manage your employee's handles through a Google Sheet by using this Worker.

So, if you had this in your Google Sheet, Pedro would be able to setup @pedro.company.com, Lucas would have @lucas.company.com and so on.
